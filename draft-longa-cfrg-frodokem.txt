1.  Introduction

   FrodoKEM is a conservative yet practical post-quantum key
   encapsulation mechanism whose security derives from cautious
   parameterizations of the well-studied learning with errors problem,
   which in turn has close connections to conjectured-hard problems on
   generic, "algebraically unstructured" lattices.

   As a key encapsulation mechanism, FrodoKEM is a three-tuple of
   algorithms (_KeyGen_, _Encapsulate_, _Decapsulate_):

   *  _KeyGen_ takes no inputs, requires randomness, and outputs a
      private key and a public key;

   *  _Encapsulate_ takes as input a public key, requires randomness,
      and outputs a ciphertext and a shared secret;

   *  _Decapsulate_ takes as input a ciphertext and a private key, and
      outputs a shared secret.

   These algorithms are assembled as a two-pass protocol that allows two
   parties to derive a shared secret.  This shared secret can then be
   used to establish a secure communication channel using a symmetric-
   key algorithm.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Security Considerations

   FrodoKEM-640, FrodoKEM-976 and FrodoKEM-1344 are designed to be post-
   quantum IND-CCA2 secure KEMs at the security levels of AES-128,
   AES-192 and AES-256, respectively.

   Users are recommended to use the highest possible security level that
   a given application allows.  In particular, the designers of FrodoKEM
   recommend to use either FrodoKEM-976 or FrodoKEM-1344 for most
   applications, and limit the use of FrodoKEM-640 to applications that
   require short-term security.

   Lattice-based cryptographic schemes such as FrodoKEM are still
   relatively young.  Therefore, it is recommended to use FrodoKEM in
   combination with a classical scheme (e.g., based on elliptic curves)
   while our confidence in the security of lattice schemes increases
   over time.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
